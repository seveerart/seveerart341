        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: I'm hoping to get a grasp of the very basics of coding and how to utilize all the resources out there to make cool sites rather than just doing it all from complete scratch and thinking I can't borrow snippets from other sources. I don't think I'd be able to get to this point by the end of this term, but I think it'd be cool to code my own portfolio site. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: I am doing my project on the different forms of aurora borealis. I plan to showcase photos of four different shapes of the aurora borealis that are commonly seen, along with a text description of them (what they look like, when they happen, where, why, etc.). I am thinking of using a color palette that is made up of colors that are typically seen in the aurora borealis, maybe with glows around buttons when hovered over. For imagery, I want to show the range of color they can have, though I'm not sure if I'll have any treatment for them. It'd be interesting to play with the edges of the images themselves and have them be soft and fade into the background. I also considered having them in a polaroid format, seeing as photography of such phenomena is decently common. I'm not sure what I'm doing in terms of type yet. My first thought is something sans serif, but I don't have any particular reasoning for that.    </p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
        <p>Response: I imagine the user of my aurora borealis site being someone somewhat like me; someone who appreciates nature and the night sky and all of the beauty that comes with it. Their hobbies might be hanging out outside with some trees, listening to ambient or atmospheric music across the musical genres. I feel like this person wouldn’t have easy access to viewing the aurora borealis in their own life, so they admire photos of it online.</p>

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Why did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? what bothers you abut them? How will you improve things in your own design.</p>
        <p>Response: I chose to redesign Music Millennium’s website because I find it cluttered and overwhelming. It’s \\\\ 4r========= hard to navigate since the landing page has so many sections to it so it feels like it just keeps going. It has a section for pre-ordering upcoming releases, featured releases, “What’s New” for the week, a Spotify playlist, a “New Release Round-Up”, a list of other releases out that week, more upcoming releases, a couple of videos that I’m not sure what they’re supposed to go with, new things for another list, the Spotify playlist again, and finally a button to see all their news article. I think this page needs to be split up and have buttons to get to the different sections. There’s also a side bar where you can sign up for their email list (and “More Stuff” and “Featured Genres”) that is quite a way down the page, which doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, as someone who doesn’t scroll down won’t see it. There’s also a bunch of changing banners that don’t fit together and just get distracting. The website’s header includes an image that makes it difficult to read the text and icons over it. In my design, I am hoping to tidy up and simplify the site to make it easier and more straight-forward to navigate.

        <h2>Week Eight</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Read <a href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00">this article on mobile first design</a> and share your thoughts on mobile first vs desktop first.</p>
        <p>Response: I think that mobile first does seem like a better way to go about designing rather than the other way around. It forces you to get the structure and content down and functional while looking like it was intentional, not just shrunken down awkwardly from a desktop version. Once all the necessary mobile components are in place, then you can move on to the more aesthetic pieces and extras there and especially when working on the desktop version. </p>

        <h2>Week Nine</h2>
        <p>Prompt: This one's about "why." Read this article. Spend some time thinking about why you are pursuing a career in design. Really dig down, do the 7 "whys" tool in the article. OR If that's too challenging right now, consider people in your life or people who've inspired you. Think about what drives them, what their "why" is. Why did they work so hard to do XYZ, was it from past experiences they had, was it because they saw a need they were called to fill? What's their deeper "why?"? Ask them if you know them, or look up some biographical information and try to figure it out. Write about either you or your inspiration. </p>
        <p>Response: I ended up doing a bit of a free-write train of thought dive into why I am pursuing a career in design. They don’t all exactly go together, but they’re different reasons I thought of while thinking about it. 
          <ul>
          <li>I like doing more illustrative art, but design is more practical as a career, and can incorporate illustration.</li>
          <li>I want to be able to have an income doing something I enjoy.</li> 
          <li>I want to have an income so I can afford to move out and live on my own, hopefully move to Sweden or Norway. -> Living in one of these countries I feel like would be a nice change from living in the US my whole life and resenting it. -> I like the weather and cultures there. -> They have cool music scenes that I think it’d be rad to design and illustrate for. </li>
          <li>I’ve always thought doing the artwork for musicians seemed like it’d be fun </li>
          <li>I want to be one of those artists that people with similar interests to me look up to and whose work they enjoy.</li>
          <li>I’d like to get to a point where I can do my own thing primarily, which I feel like I’d have to start out with freelance design to work my way over to creating what I like and being able to sell it (as prints, pins, stickers, etc). I know I can do this now, which I’m working on. It’s just a challenge. </li>
          </ul>
