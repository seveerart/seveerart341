        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: I'm hoping to get a grasp of the very basics of coding and how to utilize all the resources out there to make cool sites rather than just doing it all from complete scratch and thinking I can't borrow snippets from other sources. I don't think I'd be able to get to this point by the end of this term, but I think it'd be cool to code my own portfolio site. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: I am doing my project on the different forms of aurora borealis. I plan to showcase photos of four different shapes of the aurora borealis that are commonly seen, along with a text description of them (what they look like, when they happen, where, why, etc.). I am thinking of using a color palette that is made up of colors that are typically seen in the aurora borealis, maybe with glows around buttons when hovered over. For imagery, I want to show the range of color they can have, though I'm not sure if I'll have any treatment for them. It'd be interesting to play with the edges of the images themselves and have them be soft and fade into the background. I also considered having them in a polaroid format, seeing as photography of such phenomena is decently common. I'm not sure what I'm doing in terms of type yet. My first thought is something sans serif, but I don't have any particular reasoning for that.    </p>
